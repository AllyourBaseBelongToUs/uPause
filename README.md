uPause
======

uPause allows you to pause any program on your computer, hide the window, and store it away in RAM. CPU usage of the paused programs will be 0. We aim to be as lightweight as possible. 


Why?
====

It can be really usefull for a lot of things. A lot of programs dont have a pause button, and if you want to do some cpu intensive work, but you dont want to close all your programs, this might be perfect! Also the pausing and unpausing is nearly instant, so I think it can also be used to start up programs instantly.
